# tic-tac-toe

Hello! I have created a Tic Tac Toe game in Python using basic 'if...else' statements, while loops, etc. However, * I haven't done this project entirely on my own. * I have taken some help from the course I'm currently doing on Udemy. 

Course name: The Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python ~~~ Jose Portilla.
